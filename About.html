                I am a pationate person, although i have challenges with staying focused in the IT field due to being a core Electrical Engineer, I am motivated to put in all the effort needed to achieve this cloud engineering track.
                <q>At some point in the life of a man he will seek more for himself</q>, i believe i am at that point. <br><br>
                Even when people say IT will be replaced by AI or Robots i believe their data and Instruction sets will be stored somewhere and that is the cloud, <em>that is where i want to be.</em> <br><br>
                I want to appreciate ALT School for this opportunity to learn under great men and women. I am just starting but i am a <strong>winner</strong> already.
